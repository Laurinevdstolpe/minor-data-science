Datacamp courses:
- 9 courses of Datacamp, see screenshots (in repository -> minor-data-science).

Reflection and evaluation:   (400 woorden en STARR method)
(Reflection on own contribution to the product) //
(Reflection on own learning objectives) //
(Evaluation on the group project as a whole) //

Research project:
(Task definition) Rick and I sat together to clearly discribe the context and research question a few times.
We had to adjust the reserch question a few times, because we knew what the problem owner wanted, but not how we would get there.
Which question did we have to ask ourselves to get to the model for the problem owner.
(Evaluation) //
(Conclusions) //
(Planning) Rick and I sat together for a few times to plan the whole project.
I came up with the idea to do one sprint a week where we come together on monday and figure out what we want to do that week.
Also I came up with the plan to do literature study till week 8 and then begin with the models that we found in the literature.
Rick and I described an overview for the rest of the teammembers, so how many weeks we have till the final presentation and what we should do in that time.
You can see what we did in the onderzoeksplan in teams by planning.

Predictive analytics:
(Selecting a model) I chose the silmpe models to get a good insight to models and which work best on our data.
(Configuring a model) The models I've made are a good first step to creating a model according to my literature book (https://otexts.com/fpp3/).
(Training a model) //
(Evaluating a model) //
(Visualizing the outcome of a model) //

Domain knoweldge:
(Introduction of the subject field) //?
(Literature research) I found a great book that helps you with setting up a simple model (https://otexts.com/fpp3/).
It helped me a lot, especially chapter 5, where they explain the simple methods.
(Explanation of terminology, jargon and definitions) //?

Data preprocessing:
(Data exploration) //
(Data cleaning) // In the weekends there were a lot of zero-values, so I had to filter those out.
(Data preporation) // With client 4 for example I needed to filter the first two years out, because it became a client after that.
(Data explenation) //
(Data visualization) //

Communication:
(Presentations) I prepared and gave 1 presentation on friday the 25th of september. 
You may have noticed that since I changed the formatting of the slides this presentation, everybody is re-using that format.
I gave it a ogange look and put the PostNL logo on every slide so it is obvious what group we are.
I got two questions and anwsered them myself, for the rest I only got good feedback from the problem owner and the supervisors. 
(Writing paper) //
