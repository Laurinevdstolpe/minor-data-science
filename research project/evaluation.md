# Evaluation

When I was working on the mvlr model I discussed with Rick and Idriss what features te use. We dicided to use day of the week, month of the year, number of parcels week before and hollidays. I looked at wheather, but the correlation was not good so we deleted that one. I also looked into Google trends, but there was not enough time in this project to really get into that. It also was really hard to come up with Google trend words for the model to put it in as a feature, because we did not know which client was with which company, we only saw client numbers. So Google trends is something future data analists can look into, because I believe it can really help the model. I also tried to make a [neural network](), but it was too hard for beginners like me. Also now we have a seperate model for every client, but maybe in the future there will be a model for all clients to predict the number of parcels. We tried this, but failed.
