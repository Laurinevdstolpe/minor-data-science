## Evaluation

So in this research I have looked into what features has to be in mvlr model when you want to predict the number of parcels for the next day. I came to the conclusion that the features day of the week and holidays are good features. The features like Google trends did not make the cut, because it was too hard to implement when you don't know what client you have the data from. So for example if you have a bikini shop, then you would use the word 'bikini' for Google trends, but we don't know the client. I did try this though, as you can see [here](https://github.com/Laurinevdstolpe/minor-data-science/blob/main/research%20project/mvlr%20feature%20google%20trends%20klant%20153.ipynb). So google trends can be something for future research. Also We now only had time to each pick one client of the dataset and configurate a model on this client, but in the future maybe all clients ca have their own mvlr-model. The last thing that future researchers can look at is a neural network for predicting the packages. I looked into that, but it was too hard for a beginner like me. [Here]() you can see how far I got.
