In the beginning of this project I said that we should do a daily standup every day, except for weekends, but the majority of the group didn't agree and said they didn't want to be awake that early every day. So we decided to try three times a week (monday, wednesday and friday), but after we had our meeting with Gerda we knew that wasn't going to work so we changed it to my proposal and do it five times a week. Rick and I sat together for a few times to plan the whole project.
In week 7 I came up with the idea to do one sprint a week where we come together on monday and figure out what we want to do that week, we call this sprint planning. Rick than said that we also needed a retrospective, so we have been doing this ever since. (You can find this in the map Retrospective under Parcel).
Also I came up with the plan to do literature study till week 8 and then begin with the models that we found in the literature.
Rick and I described an overview for the rest of the teammembers, so how many weeks we have till the final presentation and what we should do in that time.
(You can see what we did in the onderzoeksplan in teams by planning.)
