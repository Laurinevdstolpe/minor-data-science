# Selecting a model

We got the data from PostNL, which was a dataset with:  
- Procesdag  

- Cust_id  

- Aantal pakketten  

- Aantal pakketten volgende dag  




As a group we decided that we would split up in two groups of three. My group had to create a multivariate linear regression model. We decided this model was the right model for our problem, because I did literature study on it (https://otexts.com/fpp3/) and it came out as a good model to start with. It was also recommended by our instructors.
