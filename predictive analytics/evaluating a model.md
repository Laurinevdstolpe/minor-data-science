# Evaluating a model

When I take a look at my previous model, which was lineair regression, I see that mvlr is a lot better. Here you can see for yourself the screenshots of the evaluation of [mvlr](https://github.com/Laurinevdstolpe/minor-data-science/blob/main/predictive%20analytics/2021-01-12%20(5).png) and [lineair regression](https://github.com/Laurinevdstolpe/minor-data-science/blob/main/predictive%20analytics/2021-01-12%20(6).png). The mvlr model works a lot better than the lr model. Maybe the lr model overfits in a way.
