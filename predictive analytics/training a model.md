# Training a model

When I trained the model I did only the training and test split. I didn't do the validation bit, because it was too hard to find out how you do this. I did a lot of research and asked around, but eventually gave up. When Rick figured it out I was too busy working on the paper, so I didn't have time to really look into how he did it and I didn't just want to copy paste ofcourse. So [here](https://github.com/Laurinevdstolpe/minor-data-science/blob/main/predictive%20analytics/2021-01-12%20(4).png) is a screenshot of how I now trained my mvlr model.
