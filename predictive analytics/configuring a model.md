# Configuring a model

With the mvlr-model I first made a feature selection. I made a correlation matrix of the next features:
- [holidays](https://github.com/Laurinevdstolpe/minor-data-science/blob/main/predictive%20analytics/2021-01-12.png)
- [google trends](https://github.com/Laurinevdstolpe/minor-data-science/blob/main/predictive%20analytics/2021-01-12%20(1).png)
- [knmi weather data](https://github.com/Laurinevdstolpe/minor-data-science/blob/main/predictive%20analytics/2021-01-12%20(2).png)
- [weekdays](https://github.com/Laurinevdstolpe/minor-data-science/blob/main/predictive%20analytics/2021-01-12%20(3).png)

After deciding that the knmi feature was not relevant and the google trends data was too hard to implement I started to train the model and eventually evaluate the model, [here is a link to my model](https://github.com/Laurinevdstolpe/minor-data-science/blob/main/predictive%20analytics/MVLR%20klant%20153%20(2).ipynb).
