# Presentations

I prepared and gave my first presentation on friday the 25th of september. 
You may have noticed that since I changed the formatting of the slides this presentation, everybody is re-using that format.
I gave it an orange look and put the PostNL logo on every slide so it is obvious what group we are.
I got two questions and anwsered them myself, for the rest I only got good feedback from the problem owner and the supervisors. 
[Here](https://github.com/Laurinevdstolpe/minor-data-science/blob/main/Communication/ppt%20week%204.pptx) is that presentation, only the graphs I put in later and forgot to save.

Then I prepared and gave another presentation on monday the 16th of november. The questions that were asked here, I awnsered myself. I got a comment that we had to take a look at the day before and not the week before when we predict the number of parcels. This was a usefull comment of Jeroen Vuurens. For the rest I was told that we had to tell more about what we train, validate and test our model on. Also usefull. For the rest there were no remarks.

And my last presentation was on the 4th of january. Here I also got no questions that I could not awnser.

I believe that I will also do the final presentation, but we have not decided that yet.
