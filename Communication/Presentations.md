I prepared and gave 1 presentation on friday the 25th of september. 
You may have noticed that since I changed the formatting of the slides this presentation, everybody is re-using that format.
I gave it a ogange look and put the PostNL logo on every slide so it is obvious what group we are.
I got two questions and anwsered them myself, for the rest I only got good feedback from the problem owner and the supervisors. 
Then I prepared and gave another presentation on monday the 16th of november. The questions that were asked here, I awnsered myself. I got a comment that we had to take a look at the day before and not the week before when we predict something. This was a usefull comment of Jeroen Vuurens. For the rest I was told that we had to tell more about what we train, validate and test our model with. Also usefull. For the rest there were no remarks.
