# Writing paper

I made an [overview](https://github.com/Laurinevdstolpe/minor-data-science/blob/main/Communication/overview.md) of what had to be in the paper in Dutch.


I also looked into the slides that were on blackboard and decided to put every part on a seperate page and translate them to Dutch, because two of our groupmembers are really bad at English. Then I made the [introduction](https://github.com/Laurinevdstolpe/minor-data-science/blob/main/Communication/introduction.md), the [data](https://github.com/Laurinevdstolpe/minor-data-science/blob/main/Communication/Data.md) bit and made up a title. After these were done we had to divide the rest for the Christmas break and so we split up in groups of two and Emir and I had to make the Techniques and discussion. First I made an overview of what techniques had to go in and then I did the [techniques](https://github.com/Laurinevdstolpe/minor-data-science/blob/main/Communication/technieken.md) that were used on multivariate lineair regression and Emir the techniques of SARIMA. Ofcourse we checked eachother as well. And with the [discussion](https://github.com/Laurinevdstolpe/minor-data-science/blob/main/Communication/discussion.md) I again made an overview and did the mvlr part.
