# Introduction to the subject field

In this minor we learn to apply coding to models so we can predict a certain something with the given data. First we get the data, then find a model, then train the model and eventualle evaluate the model. The subject field of the assignment PostNL gave us is very broad. The only demarcation is that it has to be a timeseries model. Also the data reached from the 2nd of january 2015 to the 30th of april 2020. But because of Covid we decided that it was better not to involve 2020. But besides the timeseries and data demarcation we were free to do our own thing.
