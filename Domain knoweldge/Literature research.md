# Literature research

I found eleven relevant articles about machine learning in predicting things. But not all of them are still in our shared document, because we had to select two of them, but here are four (the first two I selected as best):
1. [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/)
**Google scholar term : forecasting**

2. [Forecast of the Commercial UAS Package Delivery Market]
**Google scholar term: how to forecast package delivery**

*(The link doesn't work, but if you just fill in the link in Google scholar, it is the first one.)*

3. [Method for forecasting consumption and generating optimal delivery schedules for vehicles involved in delivering propane and other consumables to end consumers](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7676404B2/en) 
**Google scholar term : forecasting package delivering**
 
4. [techniques for forecasting](https://books.google.nl/books?hl=nl&lr=&id=8FppWLEFHU8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA4&dq=techniques+for+time+series&ots=b4Yqk5UHtt&sig=DhC0AqOOX72d90NDCVdaTrpkwj8&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=techniques%20for%20time%20series&f=false)
**Google scholar term: time series analyses**
